## render combat
- make current combat node a object/resource of a  bigger combat node
- current combat node emits signals that tell the master combat node to do things like animate fumos fighting n shiii
- we'll need an elegant way to get a fumo's area from it's data. maybe a map that we keep up to date? 
- dicts are pass by value so that could be annoying though
